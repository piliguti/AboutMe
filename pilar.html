<html><head><title> About Pili </title></head><body><img src = "pilar.jpg"><h1> Pilar </h1><p> 	Hello my name is Pilar! I am 16 years old and I am a Junior at Radford School. I have a 3 year-old brother, his name is Joaquin. I only see him in the summers because he lives in Spain with my dad and stepmom. I used to live in Spain until I was 8 years old and then I moved to El Paso. So now, I get experience both places, so it is a lot of fun. </p><p>	I have danced ballet since I was 3 and I sadly quit when i was 14. It was really hard for me to quit but it stopped being fun for me and it interfered with what I really wanted to do, act. I have been in a total of 9 plays. My top three favorite were Seussical (I played Gertrude), The Little Mermaid (I played Sebastian), and Mary Poppins (I played Mary Poppins). I feel like a completely different person on stage and surprisingly I don't get stage fright. I love developing a character because it is very important to make them unique and give than little quirks that make them funny, but I also have to remember to keep it consistent. People have told me that I must be a really good liar since I am a good actress, but the truth is far from that. I am a horrible liar off the stage, I don't know why! </p><p> 	I have a little guinea pig, his name is Howard, but I call him Howy. He is really cute and gives me kisses all the time. He has his own instagram page. <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/howy_theguineapig/"</a> , you should follow it. </a> </p><br><p> Hopefully he will become famous one day! I buy little outfits for him so he can always look stylish.</p><h1> Would you like to see more of me? </h1><p> If so follow my <a href = "https://vsco.co/piliguti/images/1"</a> vsco </a> </p><br><h1> Need to contact me? </h1><p> My email is pilargutierrezcolom@gmail.com </p> </body></html>
